# go-feature

> Package feature provides a simple mechanism for creating and managing feature flags.

See [./examples/hello](./examples/hello/hello.go) for an example.

## Building and testing

The Makefile is set up to work with a project-local GOPATH.  Thus you
can just run `make` to build the example, or `make test` to run the
tests.
